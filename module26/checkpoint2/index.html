				<p>Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the
					sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear). They’re found throughout North
					America, South America, Europe, and Asia.</p>

				<p>They have nonretractable claws, short tails, and excellent sense of smell. They’re typically solitary, except for
					mothers with cubs. There are eight species: Asiatic black bears (also called moon bears), brown bears (which include
					grizzly bears), giant pandas, North American black bears, polar bears, sloth bears, spectacled bears (also called Andean
					bears), and sun bears.</p>
